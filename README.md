# Discord Audio Player
Made With Python 3.9 and discord.py 2.3

## Description
This Discord bot has all the implementation to play an audio file in a voice channel. It uses the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API and the PyNaCl library to encode the audio file.
## Usage
To use the bot, you need to have a bot token and a voice channel to join. You can get a bot token by creating a new bot in the Discord Developer Portal and you can get a voice channel to join by creating a new server or joining an existing one.
<br>**Note:** The bot needs to have the "Connect" and "Speak" permissions in the voice channel to join and play audio.

## Installation
For some, running this could be more complicated since you need to have ffmpeg installed on your system. You can download it from the official website [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), add it to your system's PATH and restart your PC.
